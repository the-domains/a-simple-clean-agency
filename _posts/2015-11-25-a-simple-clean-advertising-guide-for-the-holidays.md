_November + December makeup 80%+ of 2015 revenue, so make sure that your Advertising attracts, converts, and engages your highly targeted customers._

**There are 3 questions that you must ask before advertise to your highly targeted customers.**

**1) Who are my customers that will spend 4x, 16x, 64x, etc.?**

**2) Why do they buy from me?**

**2) Where are they social?**
